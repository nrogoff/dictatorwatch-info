# Initial React basic app

[Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview) allows you to easily build [React](https://reactjs.org/) apps in minutes. Use this repo with the [React quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/getting-started?tabs=react) to build and customize a new static site.
